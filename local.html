                    The Stanford NLP Group is always on the lookout for budding new
                    computational linguists.  Stanford has a great program at the
                    cutting edge of modern computational linguistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best way to get a sense of what goes on in the NLP Group is
                    to look at our <a href="/blog/">research blog</a>,
                    <a href="/pubs/">publications</a>, and <a
                        href="/people/">students' and faculty's homepages</a>.  Our
                    research centers around using probabilistic and other machine
                    learning methods over rich linguistic representations in a
                    variety of languages.  The group is small, but productive and
                    scientifically focused.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Where do you apply for graduate (PhD or MS) study?  Not directly
                    to the NLP
                    Group.  Stanford graduate admissions are handled through
                    individual departments, so you'll want to apply for admission
                    through either the <a
                        href="http://linguistics.stanford.edu/">Linguistics
                    Department</a> or the <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/">Computer
                    Science Department</a>.  Both departments have excellent
                    graduate programs.  Normally, you should apply to the one in
                    which you have more background and greater interest in further
                    study.   Do make sure that you emphasize
                    any research experience and results, and that you get letter writers who
                    can speak convincingly about you.  Decisions about admissions are
                    made by the department's admissions committee.
                    Because admissions committees represent the whole
                    department and aim to select the best applicants regardless of
                    specialization, you should direct your application towards an
                    appropriately broad audience. And, as you probably know,
                    Stanford admissions are quite competitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have questions about admissions, please check the
                    graduate admissions web pages listed on the right, or write to
                    the admissions email addresses listed.  We NLP Group members
                    attempt to answer specific NLP-related admissions questions
                    (although sometimes we get too busy...), but in general it isn't
                    necessary or helpful to contact us to let us know that you want to
                    apply or have applied for admission.
